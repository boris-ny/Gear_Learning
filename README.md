# Gear_Learning

This a prototype of a website to help people who are abut to take their theory driving test to study and practicesome sample questions. Currently have one topic about road signs for this prototype but more will be added in the future. You should be able to learn about the different road signs and their meanings. You can also practice some sample questions to test your knowledge.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- You have a basic understanding of JavaScript and React.

## Using React + Vite

To use React + Vite, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/boris-ny/Gear_Learning.git
```

### Navigate into the project directory

```bash

cd Gear_Learning && cd client
```

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the application running.

## Backend

I had writeen a structure for the backend but I didn't have time to implement it. I will be working on it in the future. You can see the content of the backend however its not being fetched by the frontend.

## Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
